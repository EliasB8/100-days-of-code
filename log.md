### Day 10: June 13, Monday, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the functional programming module of fcc's JS Certificate. I completed 25% of this moudle. Functional Programming is a whole new dimension of programming. I struggled a bit in the challenges due to arrays and passing them by reference or by value. Then Googling helped. 

**Thoughts**: Google is my bff. I really admire the developers that existed before GOOGLE. They should be very very special. ðŸ¤£
